# Changelog

All notable changes to alpha-AOS are documented in this file. The format follows Keep a Changelog, and the project uses Semantic Versioning.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Declarative, preview-first installation and reconciliation for supported agent harnesses.
- Evidence-matched project capability packs and native optional capability routing.
- Mandatory GSD quality gates for security- and migration-sensitive work.
- Persistent directory tree-off policy that keeps opted-out trees free of alpha-AOS-managed global customization.
- Transactional managed lifecycle operations covering status, doctor, rollback, repair, and uninstall.
- One authoritative allowlisted release tarball, cross-platform fixture verification, and cryptographic provenance records.

### Security

- Release archives exclude candidate locks, planning state, tests, sources, and other unreviewed local artifacts.
- Provenance verification binds the archive SHA-256, `dist/build-artifact.json`, `catalog/stack.lock.json`, and every packaged `dist` output recorded by the build artifact manifest.
- Preview remains the default; public publication requires the explicit `--publish` release flag after all verification gates pass.

## Active Harnesses

Codex, Antigravity, Pi, and Hermes are the active v0.1.0 target scope. “Active” identifies product scope; it does not itself mean a live capability is **PROVEN**. The committed [support matrix](docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md) is authoritative and currently reports live rows as **UNVERIFIED** until a matching, inspectable invocation receipt exists. Antigravity remains **UNVERIFIED** where the closed host ledger cannot represent its invocation proof.

## Compatibility Residue

Claude Code remains shipped compatibility **RESIDUE**. It is outside active v0.1.0 development, advertised support, acceptance bars, and release gates.

## Known Platform Limitations

- Windows supplies floor environment names including `USERPROFILE` and `APPDATA` to child processes. alpha-AOS redirects relevant values inside fixtures and redacts diagnostics; it does not promise those OS-provided names are absent.
- OS/container-backed `sealed` isolation (`SEAL-01`) is deferred to v2. v0.1.0 `project-only` mode is configuration isolation, not a security sandbox, and `sealed` continues to fail closed without an adapter.
